# daily-learning-md

A simple plugin for markdown blogs that generates questions, hints, and a place to answer.

Motivated by spaced repetition (similar to Anki) as a form of learning over time.

## TODO
- Ensure that we don't generate the same question twice.
- Add answer generation. The question + hint generation of tomorrow should answer / grade my answer for today.
